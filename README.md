# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
This project is a simple decentralized voting system built on Ethereum using Solidity. It allows the contract owner to add candidates and enables users to vote for their preferred candidate securely and transparently on the blockchain. Each address can vote only once, ensuring fairness.

## Project Vision
To create a tamper-proof, transparent voting system that leverages blockchain technology to ensure integrity, eliminate fraud, and increase voter confidence in elections and polls.

## Key Features
- Owner can add multiple candidates.
- Users can cast a single vote per address.
- Votes are counted and stored immutably on-chain.
- Transparent and auditable voting process.
- Event emitted on every vote to facilitate easy tracking.

## Future Scope
- Add voting deadlines and result declaration.
- Implement vote delegation and weighted voting.
- Integrate with frontend dApp for better user experience.
- Support for multiple simultaneous polls.
- Privacy-preserving voting mechanisms using zk-SNARKs or homomorphic encryption.
